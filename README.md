# Q2RPGPack

PLEASE READ SO YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THIS PACK!

DROP YOUR REGISTERED QUAKE2 PAKS INTO BASEQ2! OR THIS WILL NOT LOAD. ALSO TYPE CL_DRAWSTRAFEHELPER 1 IN THE CONSOLE 


This is my custom pack I have put together for playing on the Quake2 RPG Server. I have pieced this together from various places and I am simply sharing it with other people so they can use it. Let me explain what I included:

*High visbility skins for Monsters/Items/Weapons/Ammo (I created the High Visibility Monster skins. I used the Quake2 AI Upscale Pack and Added Red coloring to make the monsters easier to see. Please note I made the Gladiator Green and the rest of the mosnters Red. The gladitor is the biggest threat (in my opinion) on the server so I wanted to make sure he stood out from the rest. I downloaded the item/weapon visability skins from another pack I will include the credits for everything included in this pack.

*Custom Quake2Pro exe made for speedrunning. This custom Q2PRO I have included because it has a strafe helper included with it. It will put a scale on screen under the status bar that will guide you on what angles are the best for bunnyhopping. I find this custom Q2Pro coming in handy a lot to escape from monsters when low on health to maximize distance between hitscanners.

*Custom Zoom + Quick Grapple Binds (Please note that with this Q2PRO exe I do not know how to go back to the weapon you originally started with. So I simply included a weaprev after the Quick Grapple. I found these Grapple and Zoom scripts on the internet. The Zoom script comes in very handy. 

*If anyone knows how to get ahold of some of the UnH0ly paks there is a certain sound I would like to include in this modpack for a grenade count down I would assume that these packs would be on discord. I could be wrong though. 

*If anyone has any suggestions to add to this pack I am all ears. 

*This pack was built by installing the Q2Pro starter pack and ovverwriting the EXE with Q2PRO-Speed. This fixes the annoying Gun FOV problem that happens when installing Q2PRO. I do not know why but it works and I do it everytime I install Quake2. I get so annoyed by the Gun FOV being fucked up.



I have put custom binds in the Autoexec.cfg. I have used my binds on the autoexec.cfg.   Feel free to edit the config. Please be aware that dropping ammo is a very useful bind. More useful than you might think. If you drop shells, and pick them back up it allows different ammo to spawn (For Example). It is a lifesaver if you are against a group of monsters and are strugging for a certain type of ammo.

Binds you should be aware of: 

+zoom  (obvious)
+hook (Quick Grapple)
F is bound to simply use the grappling hook
Mouse 3 is set to Zoom
cl_drawstafehelper will enable and disable the strafebar. Please be aware of cl_starfe commands to customize the strafe bar if you so desire. 




I would like to add Ammo counts on the right side of the screen but I have no idea how this could be possible. 


Enjoy!
